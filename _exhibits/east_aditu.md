l1: East China is one of the geographical regions in China, which is not completely equivalent to east China economic zone in economic geography.
l2: East China in the current sense is "six provinces and one city in East China", including Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian and Shanghai. The Government of the People's Republic of China also incorporated Taiwan province into east China, but it never actually managed and controlled Taipeng Jinma.
