l1: Yanji Cold Noodles (연길랭면) is one of the "Top Ten Noodles in China" and is a traditional Chinese Korean food.
l2: In the late 19th century, cold noodles were introduced to the north-east of China by the Korean people, and gradually a distinctive Yanji cold noodles was formed. 
l3: Located in the eastern part of Jilin Province, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture shares a border with North Korea, where the Korean people make up 42.3% of the total Korean population in China, so the food habits of Yanji are mostly similar to those of North Korea, but also incorporate the tastes of the Han Chinese.
